                We invite everyone in our community to host an event.
                React.Cologne is a community meetup and not run by a single
                company. Our hosts sponsor the meetup by providing a suitable
                location, free drinks and snacks for their event.
              </p>
              <p>
                We require future hosts to attend at least one previous meetup
                event. We do this to make sure that they see how a React.Cologne
                meetup is usually run, and to ensure that companies are invested
                into our community beyond just a single event.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have around 35-50 participants and need room for 2 parallel
                sessions, so your location should be suitable for it. Your
                location should also be accessible from central Cologne with
                public transport.
              </p>
